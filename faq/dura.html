      <p>
        Trap Durability, usually shortened as Trap Dura, is a stat that determinates
        how long your traps last, this is really important for this base since you're
        going to be running a mission that lasts over 2 hours and your traps need to last
        throughout the entire mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get more Trap Durability, you’ll need get <strong>Trap Durability Survivors</strong>. 
        You're aiming to get about 250%, the higher the better, if you don't have enough with the
        survivors you have, you can use lower rarity and lower level survivors, their power level
        will not affect how much your traps last.
        Using <strong>Machinist Harper</strong> will grant an additional 52% when set as commander.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to see how much you have, go to "Command" -> "See All Stats" and then scroll down
        all the way, there, you will see "Trap Durability".
